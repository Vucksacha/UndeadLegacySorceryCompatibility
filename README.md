# Undead Legacy / Sorcery Compatibility
This is a modlet allowing Sorcery compatibility with the Undead Legacy Overhaul Mod

Installation Instructions:

	Initial Step: Make sure you have a clean installation of 7 Days to Die. Re-install if necessary.

	Step 1: Download this mod's supported Undead Legacy Mod (currently 2.6.17 stable for A20.7)
		http://ul.subquake.com/download
		Using any other version may work but is at your own risk
	Step 2: Download this mod's supported Sorcery Mod (currently v1.72)
		http://download.sorcerymod.com/
		Using any other version may work but is at your own risk
	Step 3: Unzip UndeadLegacy-master.zip and copy the entire content of the UndeadLegacy-master folder into your 7DTD game folder
	Step 4: Unzip Sorcery-master.zip and copy the Sorcery folder within the Sorcery-master folder into the \Mods folder of your 7DTD game folder
	Step 5: Rename the copied Sorcery folder to zSorcery
		The game loads Mods in alphabetical order. The Undead Legacy folders must be loaded first, followed by the zSorcery Mod folder.
	Step 6: 
		Multiplayer Server Install:
			Copy the zUndeadLegacySorceryCompatibility folder from this folder into the \Mods folder of your 7DTD server folder

		Single Player Local Installs:
			Copy the zUndeadLegacySorceryCompatibility folder from this folder into the \Mods folder of your 7DTD game folder

		If you connect to servers who run both, you do not have to do anything as this mod is server-side and will be loaded when you connect

	You're done!
